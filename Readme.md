This project explores the following concepts:

- **API Security**: REST API calls using a custom proxy server for authentication.
- **Light/Dark mode**: User theme customization.
- **CSS Grids**: Display of search results as cards.

## Instructions

In order to run this application locally, please sign up to the [The Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com) in order to get your own API key.

Then in your local copy of this repository, create a `.env` file inside the webapp folder and add your API key in the following format:

```
OMDB_API_KEY = [Your API key]
```
